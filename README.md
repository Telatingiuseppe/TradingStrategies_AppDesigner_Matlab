# TradingStrategies_AppDesigner_Matlab
Matlab App that given a ticker, and a user's expectation about the price, gives the followin outputs: payoff chart, asset volatility, option prices.
The app takes the last available adjusted using the code available at https://github.com/Lenskiy/Yahoo-Quandl-Market-Data-Donwloader. Very few changes have been made on that code  in order to move the focus on the adjusted close and on the computation of the volatility.
There is a parent app named "TradingStrategies". Using that app the user is able to call the children apps, each child app represents a specific trading strategy.
"TradingStrategies" and "child_trading_bull" are available. In case you need more material let me know.
